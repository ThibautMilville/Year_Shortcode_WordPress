# Year_Shortcode_WordPress
Year shortcode for WordPress. It allows you to automatically display the current year, and is particularly useful for setting a copyright in the footer of your page.

You must add this snippet in the 'functions.php' file of your child theme.
You can use it with the [year] shortcode.
